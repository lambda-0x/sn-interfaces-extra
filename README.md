# Starknet Interfaces

This repo contains interfaces for popular non-standarized starknet contract.

If you are looking for interfaces standarized by
[SNIPs](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs/) see
[sn-interfaces-core](https://github.com/lambda-0x/sn-interfaces-core).

Currently it contains few interface that are inspiried directly from
[EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/) but they will be replaced with equivalent
SNIP versions once they are standarized.
